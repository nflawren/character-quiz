# character-quiz

This was created as a class project involving creating classes and using multiple programming languages.

This project will print a menu of options to the user: play Guess What Movie, set number of players, print the rules, get results, or exit. The quiz takes a random 
Disney/Pixar character from the vector and asks the user what movie they are from. The user has 3 tries to get it right. The scores get set in the scoreboard. The 
scoreboard stores points per movie and a total score, in the game it prints the total score for each player. Get results will output a graph from python that will 
show a breakdown of points earned per movie for each player.
